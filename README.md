# Voice Tracker
https://voicetracker.connerleigh.com/

This is a simple web app that allows the user to create a list of characters, and record audio clips associated with these characters for reference. It was specifically designed to assist table top RPG game masters in remembering the unique voices they've created for their non-player characters.

The app was created using create-react-app, with material-ui to create a simple clean layout. Authentication is handled using JWT with passport, and the site and audio files are hosted on Digital Ocean.
